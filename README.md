# S.O.L.I.D Principles

Within object-oriented design, the SOLID principles, which were firstly conceptualized and introduced by 
Robert C. Martin, aka uncle Bob, in the early 2000s, are considered a foundational concept. 

Their purpose is to create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively 
work on.


#### The acronym stands for:
 - Single responsibility principle 
 - Open / Close principle 
 - Liskov substitution principle 
 - Interface segregation principle 
 - Dependency inversion principle 


## Single responsibility principle 

A class should only have one reason to change, and thus, one responsibility. 



## Open / Close principle

Your code should be open to extension, but close to modification.



## Liskov substitution principle

A child class should be able to do everything the parent class can. 



## Interface segregation principle

Only implement methods that you will use.



## Dependency inversion principle 

High level modules should not depend on lower level modules, but rather an abstraction.
